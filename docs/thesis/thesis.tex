\chapter*{Abstract}
Recent developments in Neural Networks(or Deep Learning) are promising. Some models are capable of accomplishing tasks as good as humans, or better. But we still lack the applications that are available to the public. The general opinion is, Neural Network models need expensive equipment. But that only applies to the training process, where the network learns from data. But using the trained model for inference is easier. There are also methods to reduce the computational complexity of a model. With these methods, we may be able to use cheap compute devices(i.e. Mobile Phones) for inference. Thus making some models available to public.
