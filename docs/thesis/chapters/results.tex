Results

    The results are actual statements of observations, including statistics, tables and graphs.
    Indicate information on range of variation.
    Mention negative results as well as positive. Do not interpret results - save that for the discussion. 
    Lay out the case as for a jury. Present sufficient details so that others can draw their own inferences and construct their own explanations. 
    Use S.I. units (m, s, kg, W, etc.) throughout the thesis. 
    Break up your results into logical segments by using subheadings
    Key results should be stated in clear sentences at the beginning of paragraphs.  It is far better to say "X had significant positive relationship with Y (linear regression p<0.01, r^2=0.79)" then to start with a less informative like "There is a significant relationship between X and Y".  Describe the nature of the findings; do not just tell the reader whether or not they are significant.
